* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

Before the GPS session, I haven't yet made my own repository on GitHub. I was stumbling navigating through it at first. I would also miss certain steps through the git push, merge and pull process to GitHub sometimes.

* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

After making my first repository, the whole process was clarified and made easier as well. Our mentor, John, also taught me and my pair the concept of shortcuts and simplified ways of working in the terminal and git.

* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I would my pair what her thoughts were on what we were currently working on. Also on the subject of merge-conflicts, I was about the process and what would be the proper workflow , which branch to be and merge from. I asked our guide about adding `git init` and what we should do if accidentally added to an exsisting repo.  

* **What still confuses you about Git?**

I still sometimes miss steps of the git and Github workflow. Also it was my first time dealing with a merge conflict and although it was forced and the steps so far are very clear. I'm not confident yet on how to deal with it once it conflicts much larger scale. 

* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It was a great eye opener. I was nervous and awkward at first but going through it made me realize that it was place of no judgement and that I could speak my mind freely. The more it went the more I was comfortable talking to my partner and she in turn had a lot of valuable input to share with me and I am still very grateful for her patience and kind but actionable advise.
